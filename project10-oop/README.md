# OOP Explained with a TypeScript Console Application

This TypeScript console application demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It uses classes and objects (`Person` and `Student`), showcases inheritance (`Student` extends `Person`), encapsulates data and methods within classes, and illustrates polymorphism through method overriding. It's a practical example of OOP in action.

## Details

1. **Classes and Objects**: The `Person` and `Student` classes are defined, and objects are created from these classes.
2. **Inheritance**: The `Student` class extends the `Person` class, demonstrating inheritance.
3. **Encapsulation**: Data (properties) and methods are bundled into classes.
4. **Polymorphism**: The `studentInfo` method in the `Student` class overrides the method in the `Person` class (if it existed).

## Installation

To use this app, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Run the following command in the terminal (the directory of terminal must be `project10-oop`) to install the app:

```bash
npm install -g
```

Then, run the following command to run the app:

```bash
npx oop
```

## Make changes in the project

If you want to make changes in the project, you should change code of index.ts file at `./src/index.ts`. You can run the following command to compile the TypeScript files:

```bash
tsc --watch
```

This will watch for changes in the TypeScript files and compile them to JavaScript files.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Node.js
